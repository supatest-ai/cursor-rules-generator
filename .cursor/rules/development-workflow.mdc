# Development Workflow Guide

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Start development: `pnpm dev`
3. Build project: `pnpm build`

## Core Commands
- `pnpm dev`: Start development environment
- `pnpm build`: Build for production
- `pnpm preview`: Preview production build locally
- `pnpm build:packages`: Build all packages
- `pnpm build:staging`: Build for staging environment

## Package Management
- `pnpm install`: Install dependencies
- `pnpm add <package>`: Add new dependency
- `pnpm add -D <package>`: Add dev dependency
- `pnpm update`: Update all dependencies
- `pnpm outdated`: Check for outdated packages
- `pnpm prune`: Remove unused dependencies

## Type Checking
- `pnpm type-check`: Run TypeScript type checking
- `pnpm type-check:watch`: Run type checking in watch mode

## Code Quality
- `pnpm lint`: Run linting checks
- `pnpm biome:check`: Run Biome checks
- `pnpm biome:fix`: Fix issues with Biome

## Testing

- `pnpm test:e2e`: Run Playwright end-to-end tests
- `pnpm test:e2e:ui`: Run Playwright tests with UI

## Clean Commands
- `pnpm clean`: Clean all build artifacts and dependencies
- `pnpm clean:build`: Clean build artifacts only
- `pnpm clean:deps`: Clean node_modules and reinstall
- `pnpm clean:turbo`: Clean Turborepo cache
- `pnpm clean:install`: Complete clean and fresh install

## Development Guidelines
1. Always run type-checking before committing: `pnpm type-check`
2. Format code before committing: `pnpm format`
3. Fix lint issues: `pnpm lint`
4. Run tests before pushing: `pnpm test`
5. Use the appropriate build command for your environment
6. For monorepo changes, build affected packages only
7. Keep workspace dependencies in sync
8. Keep the development environment up to date with `pnpm clean:install`

## Environment Setup
- Development: `pnpm dev`
- Vercel Preview: `vercel`
- Vercel Production: `vercel --prod`

## Troubleshooting
- If dependencies are acting up: `pnpm clean:install`
- If builds are failing: `pnpm clean:build && pnpm build`
- If types are incorrect: `pnpm type-check`
- If monorepo is out of sync: `pnpm clean && pnpm install`
- If vite is acting up: Clear cache and restart dev server
